#  Chumash Casino Resort Sold to Gaming Company

The historic Chumash Casino Resort, located in Santa Ynez, California, has been sold to a gaming company for an undisclosed amount.

The casino resort, which first opened its doors in 2001, was sold by the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians. The tribe stated that the sale would help to secure the future of their people and their children.

The new owner of the casino resort is a gaming company that already owns several other casinos in California. The company has said that it plans to continue operating the casino resort exactly as it is now.

This news comes as a surprise to many in the area, as the Chumash Casino Resort is one of the most popular destinations in Santa Barbara County. Thousands of people visit the casino every year, and it is often cited as a major employer and contributor to the local economy.

In a statement released by the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians, Chairman Kenneth Kahn said "The sale of the Resort will ensure our people's future and preserve our culture for generations to come." He went on to say that "the Tribe is committed to continuing its philanthropy efforts in our local community."

#  Chumash Tribe Sues Former Casino Partner 

The Chumash Tribe filed a lawsuit against their former casino partner, accusing them of breach of contract and fraud.

The Chumash Tribe has accused their former casino partner of breach of contract and fraud. The tribe claims that the company failed to live up to their obligations laid out in the original agreement, specifically in regards to the construction of the casino.

In addition to the breach of contract, the tribe also alleges that the company committed fraud by promising more than they could deliver. This included falsely claiming that they had been granted an exemption from environmental regulations, which led to delays in the construction process.

The Chumash Tribe is seeking damages in excess of $20 million dollars.

#  California's Highest Court Rejects Indian Gambling Expansion Bid 

The California Supreme Court has rejected a bid by four San Diego-area tribes to expand their gambling operations, dealing a major setback to their efforts to keep up with burgeoning Indian gambling throughout the state.

In a unanimous decision, the court said the Pala Band of Mission Indians, Pauma Band of Luiseño Indians, Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians and San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Apache Indians had not met their legal burden to prove that they were being harmed by gambling expansion elsewhere in California.

"The gambling activities of other tribes have not caused petitioners any specific harm that would entitle them to relief," Justice Goodwin Liu wrote for the court.

Indian gaming is now a $26 billion industry in the United States, according to the National Indian Gaming Commission. Tribes argue that Class III gaming, which includes casino-style games, is essential for their economic development and self-reliance.

The Pala Band and three other tribes sued California in federal court in 2013, seeking to overturn a state law that allowed 10 new Indian casinos to open in California since 2000. The tribes said the law had resulted in "irreparable harm" to their businesses.

A federal judge ruled against them in 2015, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last year. The case then went to the California Supreme Court.

#  Gambling Firm Pulls Out of Controversial Deal With Chumash Tribe 

On Monday, the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians announced that they had reached a deal with the gambling firm SG Gaming to manage and operate the tribe’s new casino resort. The agreement was met with immediate backlash from local residents and politicians, who claimed that the deal would bring too much traffic and noise to the small town of Solvang.

Less than a week later, SG Gaming has backed out of the deal, citing concerns about the negative publicity. In a statement, the company said: “We have decided not to pursue this opportunity further in light of recent media attention and feedback from the community. We wish the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians all the best with their plans for the resort.”

This is a major victory for the residents of Solvang, who organized a petition and staged protests against the casino proposal. However, it is likely only a temporary one, as the tribe is still planning to move forward with their project.
