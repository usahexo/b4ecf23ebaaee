#  Chumash Casino Introduces Unique VIP Blackjack Game 

In an effort to attract high rollers, the Chumash Casino has unveiled a new VIP blackjack game. The game is played with a specially made deck of cards that features larger-than-normal numbers and letters.

The casino's vice president of marketing, Jennie Díaz, says that the VIP blackjack game was created in response to customer feedback. "Our guests told us they wanted a more luxurious and exclusive experience," she said. "So we decided to create our own unique version of blackjack."

The game can be played at any of the casino's six blackjack tables. Minimum bet is $25, and the maximum bet is $10,000. Players are given 100 chips with which to play.

The dice are also oversized, and the table features a plush velvet surface. There are no seat numbers; players simply take a seat where they like. The dealer does not have a specific seat either; he or she walks around the table as the game progresses.

Díaz says that the casino plans to offer other unique games in the future. "We're always looking for new ways to excite our guests and give them a one-of-a-kind experience," she said.
