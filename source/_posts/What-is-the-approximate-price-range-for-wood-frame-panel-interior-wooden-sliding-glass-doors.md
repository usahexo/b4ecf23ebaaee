#  Are there any special installation considerations for wood frame panel interior wooden sliding glass doors?

Wood frame panel interior wooden sliding glass doors are a great way to add natural light and extra space to a room. They are also a very popular choice for bathrooms and closets. Like any other type of door, there are some special installation considerations that need to be taken into account when installing wood frame panel interior wooden sliding glass doors.

The first step is to make sure that the door opening is the right size for the door that you are installing. The opening should be at least ¾” wider and taller than the door itself. If the opening is not the correct size, you will need to either adjust it or find a different door.

Once you have determined that the opening is the correct size, you will need to install the door track. The track should be installed so that it is level and parallel to the floor. If it is not level or parallel, the door will not slide open and closed properly.

Once the track is installed, you can install the door itself. Be sure to check the manufacturers specifications for the proper installation instructions. In general, however, the hinges should be attached to the top of the doorframe and the screws should be tightened until they are snug.

The last step is to install the rollers and guides. The rollers go on each side of the door and fit into the tracks on either side of the opening. The guides go at each end of the track and help keep the door aligned while it slides open and closed.
