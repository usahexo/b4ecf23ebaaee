#  What is the K in K8? 

The K in K8 is short for kernel, which is the core of any operating system. The kernel manages resources and performs essential system functions. Android, for example, has a Linux kernel. iOS has a Darwin kernel.

Before an operating system can do anything useful, it needs a kernel. The kernel initializes the system, starts the processes and drivers that are needed to run the operating system, and provides basic services such as memory management, process synchronization, and communication with hardware devices.

Most kernels these days are multitasking kernels. This means that they can run more than one process at a time. Processes can be run in parallel, so that they can take advantage of multiple processors or cores if present. This improves performance because a process that is waiting for input or output can be run on another processor while the first processor is busy with another process.

The kernel is also responsible for security. It controls access to resources and objects, and enforces the security policies set up by the system administrator or user.
