#  Twins stun Yankees with walk-off win in extra innings!

In a thrilling game that went into extra innings, the Minnesota Twins pulled off a walk-off win against the New York Yankees.

Trailing 3-2 in the bottom of the 10th inning, center fielder Byron Buxton hit a double to left field, scoring second baseman Brian Dozier from first base and giving the Twins the victory.

It was a great comeback win for the Twins, who had earlier fallen behind by two runs.

Dozier led the Twins offense on Tuesday night, going 2 for 5 with two RBIs.

Other key contributors for Minnesota include shortstop Eduardo Escobar (3 for 5) and catcher Mitch Garver (2 for 4).

For the Yankees, Aaron Judge was the star of the show, going 3 for 4 with two home runs.

This was Judge's third multi-homer game of the season, and it helped propel New York to an early lead.


 But ultimately it wasn't enough, as the Yankees bullpen faltered in the late innings.

The Twins will look to keep their momentum going when they play the next game of this series on Wednesday night.

#  Didi homers in the 10th to lift Yankees over Twins

Didi Gregorius hit a three-run home run in the 10th inning to lift the New York Yankees over the Minnesota Twins 5-2 on Thursday.

Gregorius, who entered the game in a 1-for-21 slump, hit a slider from Addison Reed (3-4) into the second deck in left field for his 18th homer of the season.

Aroldis Chapman (4-0) pitched a scoreless 10th inning for the win.

Yankees starter Jaime Garcia allowed two runs on eight hits in six innings.

Brian Dozier and Eddie Rosario homered off Garcia. Rosario's homer was his 20th of the season.

#  Gardner's 3-run homer in 8th helps Yankees top Twins

Aaron Judge hit a tying two-run homer in the sixth inning, and Tyler Austin hit a go-ahead single in the eighth before Gardner's big blast as the Yankees rallied to beat the Twins 4-3 on Wednesday night.

Gardner connected off Addison Reed (0-1) for his second home run of the season, sending a towering drive deep into the left-field seats. Gardner also had an RBI single in the seventh.

"It was good to see Gardy hit that home run," Judge said. "That was a huge hit for us."

Yankees reliever Chad Green (1-0) pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings for the win. Dellin Betances got three outs for his first save.

Gleyber Torres singled off Reed with one out in the eighth and moved to second on a wild pitch before Judge's groundout sent him to third. Austin then singled off Trevor Hildenberger to give the Yankees their fourth win in five games.

Kyle Gibson allowed three runs - two earned - and six hits in seven innings for Minnesota. Eduardo Escobar had an RBI double and Mitch Garver an infield single among his two hits.

Austin Romine started at catcher for New York in place of Gary Sanchez, who was given a day off after catching all 14 innings of Tuesday's marathon game against Minnesota. Sanchez entered as a pinch hitter in the bottom of the eighth and stayed in to play first base.

New York Yankees (59-30) at Minnesota Twins (43-45)

1:10 p.m. ET

Yankee Stadium, Bronx, New York

Pitchers: Luis Severino (15-5, 2.94 ERA) vs. Kyle Gibson (6-8, 3.90 ERA)

The first-place New York Yankees were up against a hot team on Saturday in the Minnesota Twins. The Twins had won six of their last 10 games coming into this matchup. The Yankees sent ace Luis Severino to the mound to take on Kyle Gibson of the Twins. The game was tight until the Twins’ Max Kepler and Eddie Rosario hit two home runs in the sixth inning off of reliever Jonathan Holder to put the game away for the Twins 7-4. This was the second time this season that Kepler and Rosario have gone back-to-back in a game. With the win, the Twins improve to 44-45 on the season and remain in third place in the AL Central, while the Yankees fall to 59-30 on the season and maintain their 1.5 game lead in the AL East.


   



  Severino got off to a quick start, striking out Joe Mauer and Jorge Polanco swinging in the first inning. In the second inning, Miguel Sano led off with a triple down the right field line but was stranded there as Severino got Eduardo Escobar to fly out, struck out Kepler looking and induced an inning-ending groundout from Rosario. Severino allowed just one hit over his first five innings of work while striking out eight batters. He ran into some trouble in the sixth inning when he walked Ehire Adrianza and gave up a single to Sano before being pulled from the game. His final line was six innings pitched, two hits allowed, one run earned, two walks and 11 strikeouts; he threw 101 pitches (64 for strikes).

   

Gibson matched Severino zero for zero through four innings before allowing a solo home run to Greg Bird in the fifth inning that put the Yankees up 1-0. It didn’t take long for Gibson to respond as he led off bottom of the fifth with a double off of reliever Chad Green then scored on an RBI single by Logan Forsythe that tied upthe game at 1 apiece. Gibson continued his strong outing by retiring nine consecutive batters from there until giving up a two-run home run to Aaron Hicks with two outs in top ofthe ninth inning that put New York back up 3-1 heading intothe bottom half ofthe frame. However, with two outs and runners on firstand second base, Gibsontook advantage of Aroldis Chapman’s wildness – which included five walks onthe day –andhit a bases clearing triple that putthe Twins backup 4-3 .

The Minnesota Twins won their fourth consecutive game on Sunday, beating the New York Yankees 4-2. Brian Dozier led the way offensively for the Twins, going 3 for 4 with a home run and two RBIs. Glen Perkins pitched a scoreless ninth inning to earn his 24th save of the season.

Phil Hughes started for the Twins and gave up two runs in six innings of work. Jared Burton pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings in relief, and Perkins notched his 14th save in 15 chances since taking over as the Twins' closer.

Brian McCann hit a home run off Hughes in the sixth inning to give the Yankees a 2-1 lead. But Dozier's solo homer in the seventh tied the game, and Kurt Suzuki drove in what turned out to be the winning run with a sacrifice fly later in the inning.
