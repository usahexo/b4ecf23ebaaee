When Benicio Del Toro steps into a casino game, heads turn. The Oscar-winning actor is known for his roles in hits like Traffic and Che. So it’s no surprise that the other players at the table take notice when he sits down to play blackjack or roulette.

On this particular afternoon, Del Toro was playing roulette at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. One of the onlookers was a 43-year-old man named Paul Phua from Malaysia. The two began talking and eventually got around to discussing what each did for a living. When Del Toro revealed that he was an actor, Phua couldn’t believe it.

The conversation turned to gambling, and Del Toro revealed that he was a recreational player who liked to experiment with different games. Phua told him about his own love of gambling and how he’d made a fortune in online poker. Del Toro was fascinated and asked him many questions about the game.

Eventually, the two men swapped numbers and agreed to stay in touch. A few weeks later, they met up again at the same casino, but this time they played blackjack together. After several hours of friendly competition, Del Toro walked away with $8,000 in winnings!
