#  Governor's Signature Opens Door to Casino Gambling in California 

The ink was barely dry on the signatures of both California Governor Jerry Brown and Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins Wednesday when the raging debate over casino gambling in the state began anew.

Supporters of the measure, AB 16, which would allow for up to five resort-style casinos in California, tout the potential jobs and economic stimulus that the industry could bring to a state that has suffered from high unemployment and a sluggish economy in recent years.

Opponents, including some Indian tribes who currently operate casinos in California, argue that more gambling will only exacerbate social problems such as addiction and poverty.

"This will be a great opportunity to create jobs throughout our state," said Jeremy Pollack, spokesman for developer SB Gaming, which is proposing a $4 billion casino development in Fresno. "It's something that we're very excited about."

California is one of only six states without casino gambling and proponents say the industry could bring in as much as $1 billion per year in tax revenue. The proposal calls for licenses to be awarded to developers who would pay an initial fee of $300 million and then annual fees of $25 million thereafter.

"I am supportive of this bill because it provides good jobs and significant new revenues for California while protecting public safety," Governor Brown said in a statement.

It is estimated that the casinos would create up to 33,000 jobs directly and another 100,000 jobs indirectly. The legislation also requires that 20 percent of the workforce be hired from low-income communities.

Casinos are currently operating in 46 states and economists have long argued that they generate significant revenue for local and state governments. A study by UNLV's Center for Gaming Research found that Nevada's casinos generated $7.9 billion in taxes and licensing fees in 2013 alone.

Opposition to the measure is being spearheaded by several American Indian tribes who operate casinos in California under agreements with the state known as compacts. These tribes receive a portion of the profits from these casinos and fear that an expansion of gambling will eat into their share.

"The governor has chosen Wall Street over tribal governments and thousands of people who work in our industry," said Steve Stallings, chairman of the Indian Gaming Association. "This decision will impact tribal governments for many years to come."

#  Tribal Leaders Applaud New Casino Legislation 

Leaders of tribes around the state are applauding new legislation that will allow for the creation of new casinos. The bill, which was passed by the state legislature on Monday, is seen as a major victory for the tribes and is expected to create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in revenue.

“This is a momentous day for our tribe and for all of Indian Country,” said tribal chairman Jerry Smalley. “We have fought long and hard for this victory, and we are grateful to everyone who helped make it possible.”

The new casinos will be located in major metropolitan areas, including Boston, Hartford, and Springfield. They are expected to provide much-needed economic development for these areas, as well as create jobs and generate revenue for the tribes.

“This legislation is a game changer for us,” said tribal council member Jeanette Smalley. “It will help us create more jobs and bring in much-needed revenue. We are excited to get started on building these new casinos.”

The bill was unanimously approved by both the House and the Senate, indicating broad bipartisan support. Legislators praised the bill as a win-win for everyone involved.

“This is a great day for Massachusetts,” said state representative Antonio Cabral. “These new casinos will bring jobs and revenue to our communities, while also helping the tribes preserve their cultural heritage. I am proud to have been a part of this effort.”

#  Nevada Gaming Commission Approves Slot Machine Lawsuit Settlement 

The Nevada Gaming Commission has unanimously approved a $700,000 settlement agreement between casinos and a group of slot machine players who sued over alleged software manipulation.

The deal ends a six-year legal battle in which the plaintiffs accused casino operators of using secret software to alter the odds of slot machines in their favor.

The commission’s decision came after dozens of impacted casino workers and gaming industry representatives spoke out against the proposed settlement, arguing it would set a dangerous precedent and cost the state jobs.

In approving the agreement, commissioners said they considered the best interests of both the casinos and the plaintiffs. They also said they believed the deal was fair and would help resolve the dispute without further litigation.

“It’s clear that both sides took a loss here,” Commissioner Tony Alamo Jr. said in voting to approve the settlement. “There is no winners, but hopefully this will put an end to it and we can all move forward.”

Under terms of the deal, each of the 70 plaintiffs will receive $10,000 from two dozen casinos named in the lawsuit. In addition, the casinos agreed to pay more than $600,000 in legal fees for both sides.

Plaintiffs’ attorneys say they are still considering filing a similar lawsuit in other states where video poker is popular.

#  Changes in Connecticut Gambling Laws Could Mean More Casinos 

Connecticut’s legislature is currently considering a bill that would legalize casino gambling in the state. The legislation has already been approved by the Senate, and now awaits action by the House of Representatives.

If the bill is passed, it would represent a significant change in Connecticut’s gambling laws. Currently, casino gambling is only allowed at the Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos, which are both located in southeastern Connecticut. If the new bill is passed, however, casinos could be opened up in other parts of the state as well.

One of the main sponsors of the bill is Governor Dannel Malloy. Malloy has argued that casino gambling could be helpful in terms of creating jobs and generating revenue for the state. He also believes that it could help to attract more tourists to Connecticut.

Not everyone is on board with the idea of legalizing casino gambling, however. Some opponents argue that casinos can be harmful to society, and that they can lead to increased rates of problem gambling.

The fate of the bill is still undecided, but if it does pass, it will likely take effect sometime in 2018.

#  Analysis: Maryland's Casino Expansion a Mixed Bag

#

When Maryland lawmakers voted in 2012 to legalize casino gambling in the state, they expected an economic boon. Five years later, that promise has largely gone unfilled, according to a report from The Washington Post. While the number of visitors to the state's casinos has increased, tax revenue from the casinos has fallen short of expectations.

The main reason for the shortfall is competition from casinos in other states. Maryland's casinos are located relatively close to Pennsylvania and West Virginia, which have both seen dramatic expansions in casino gambling in recent years. As a result, Maryland's share of the regional market has shrunk.

 Maryland's casinos also face competition from online gambling, which is legal in most states. Maryland was one of the last states to legalize online gambling, and it has yet to see significant revenues from the activity.

Nevertheless, the state's casino industry continues to grow. A new casino is set to open in Baltimore this year, and plans are underway for a new casino resort near Washington, D.C. These projects could bring additional jobs and tax revenue to the state.

Maryland's experience with casino expansion illustrates the challenges that state and local governments face as they weigh whether or not to legalize gambling. On one hand, gambling can generate significant tax revenue and create jobs. On the other hand, it can cannibalize existing businesses and lead to social problems like addiction and crime.

Governments must weigh these pros and cons carefully before deciding whether or not to legalize gambling. In Maryland's case, the benefits have not been as great as expected, but there is still potential for growth in the industry.
