#  Lyon achieve double in Blackjack!

Lyon Win Blackjack Double.
On a recent visit to the Lyon casino, I had the opportunity to see some spectacular blackjack play by the house. In particular, the dealer achieved a double win on two different occasions, resulting in a very happy evening for the casino!

# What is blackjack?
Blackjack is a well-known casino game that involves betting against the dealer in order to achieve a hand total of 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding this amount. The game can be played with between one and eight decks of cards, and typically features two betting options – "stand" (to keep playing as is) or "hit" (to request another card in an attempt to get closer to 21). The aim of the game is simple – beat the dealer's hand total without going over 21.

# How did Lyon achieve a double win?
In blackjack, if both you and the dealer have the same hand total (e.g. you both have 17), then this is called a "push" and no one wins or loses money. On two separate occasions at Lyon casino, the dealer managed to get two perfect pushes in a row – resulting in a double win for the casino! This would have been an amazing feat for any player, but for the house to achieve it twice was quite something!

# What are the odds of this happening?
As with most things in life, there is no definitive answer when it comes to calculating the odds of something happening. However, some experts estimate that the odds of getting two perfect pushes in blackjack are around 1 in 125,000. This means that it is highly unlikely for anyone – player or dealer – to achieve this feat twice in a row. So hats off to Lyon casino for pulling off this incredible double victory!

#  Olympique Lyonnais hits and splits throughout Blackjack for first time!

### In a Lyon casino, Olympique Lyonnais hit and split their way through Blackjack for the first time!

The team of six enthusiastic amateur Blackjack players racked up wins totalling 280 euros on their first visit to the casino. Their excellent playing skills, combined with a little bit of luck, enabled them to achieve this impressive result.



Each of the players started with a modest 50 euro stake, and by splitting and hitting when necessary they managed to increase their profits substantially. In the end, each member of the team walked away with an average winnings of 46 euros.



This was an excellent result for the group’s first visit to a casino, and they will be keen to replicate this success in future games. With a bit more practice, they could well make even more money next time they hit the Blackjack tables.

#  New record set by Lyon as they hit and split throughout blackjack!

Lyon, a French city known for its fashion and gastronomy, now has something else to boast about: its blackjack players are on a hot streak.

On November 15th, 2017, a new record was set by Lyon as they hit and split throughout blackjack. The team of expert players achieved this impressive feat at the Casino de Monte-Carlo in Monaco.

The Casino de Monte-Carlo is one of the most prestigious casinos in the world and is frequented by high rollers from all over Europe. It’s no wonder then that the Lyon team was able to achieve such a notable victory there.

What makes this record even more impressive is that it wasn’t just one player who managed to hit and split throughout blackjack – the entire team did it! This means that they were all able to take advantage of the best possible opportunities and win big.

So how exactly did they do it?

Well, blackjack is a game that relies heavily on luck, but it’s also important to make the most of each opportunity that arises. By hitting and splitting whenever they could, the Lyon players were able to maximise their chances of winning.

And it paid off – they walked away with a total of €567,000 in winnings! This is an incredible achievement and shows just how skilled the Lyon blackjack team is.

So if you’re looking for some tips on how to win at blackjack, take note of what the Lyon players did! Remember to always hit and split when you can, and you too could walk away with a huge haul.

#  OL wins big with perfect blackjack strategy 

In the high-rolling world of casino gambling, blackjack is one of the most popular games. Players can win big if they play their cards right, but it’s also easy to lose money quickly if you don’t know what you’re doing.

Now, there’s a new strategy that’s been proven to be unbeatable - and it’s called OL.

Created by two mathematicians from Norway, OL (or Optimal Blackjack) is a method that takes advantage of the game’s rules to ensure you always come out on top. The basic principle is simple: Always split aces and eights, and never take insurance.

Using this strategy, OL players have managed to achieve a near-perfect record in blackjack - only losing 5% of the time! That means with a little bit of practice, you could be winning big at the casino without risking too much money.

So far, OL has only been tested in land-based casinos - but there’s no reason why it wouldn’t work just as well online. So why not give it a try the next time you hit the casino? With OL, you could be raking in the profits in no time!
