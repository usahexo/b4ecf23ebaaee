#  Atlantic City Casino Loses Monopoly Game to Massachusetts Casino

The city of Atlantic City, long known as a gambling mecca in the United States, has lost its monopoly on casino gaming in the northeast, after a Massachusetts casino was granted approval to open last week.

The $2.6 billion MGM Springfield casino won approval from the state's gambling commission, edging out a proposal from Wynn Resorts for a $1.7 billion casino just outside Boston. The new casino is expected to create more than 4,000 jobs.

Atlantic City had been the only place in the northeast with legal casinos since 1978, when New Jersey passed a law allowing gaming in order to revitalize a flagging economy. But the advent of legalized gambling in other states, most notably nearby Pennsylvania and New York, has taken its toll on the city's casinos.

In recent years, five of Atlantic City's 12 casinos have closed, and thousands of jobs have been lost. The city's mayor said that he hoped the opening of the MGM Springfield casino would not deal another blow to Atlantic City's economy.

"We're now going into our fifth year of consecutive revenue declines," said Mayor Don Guardian in an interview with Reuters. "This could be devastating to Atlantic City."

#  Atlantic City Casino Loses Out on Monopoly Game

The newest version of the popular Monopoly game won't be coming to Atlantic City, after all.

According to reports, the multi-billion dollar company that owns the rights to the game has decided against placing its casinos in the city-despite initial plans to do so.

The decision is a big blow to Atlantic City, which is still reeling from casino closures in recent years. The city had been hoping that the new version of the game would help revive its tourism industry.

Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian expressed his disappointment with the decision in a statement released Wednesday.

"It is unfortunate that Hasbro will not be including our iconic boardwalk and casinos in their new Monopoly game," Guardian said. "This decision leaves us disappointed, but we will continue to work hard to make Atlantic City a destination for tourists and businesses."

According to Guardian, the city is still considering legal action against Hasbro for violating its contract with the city.

#  Monopoly Game Lost by Atlantic City Casino

Atlantic City casino officials say they lost $2.4 million in a single day playing the Monopoly game.

The casino said the game, which was introduced last year, is now being removed from its floor.

Officials say the game is designed for casinos to make money, but it didn't work out that way in Atlantic City.



"The rules of the game are slanted so severely against the house that it's not a fair game," said Tony Rodio, president of Tropicana Entertainment, which owns the Atlantic City casino. "We're not going to play anymore."

#  Massachusetts Casino Beats Atlantic City Casino in Monopoly Game

Boston, MA - The first legal casino in Massachusetts has won a major victory over the Atlantic City casino in a game of Monopoly.

The two casinos were playing to see who would get to own the coveted Boardwalk property. The Boston casino came out on top, winning four out of six rounds.

"We're very excited about this victory," said casino spokesperson Geraldine Herbert. "It proves that our casino is the best in the region."

The Atlantic City casino has not yet commented on the loss.

#  Atlantic City Casino Suffers Loss in Monopoly Game

The Atlantic City casino suffered a loss in the popular board game Monopoly, board members confirmed on Wednesday.

The casino’s prized Boardwalk and Park Place properties were taken by opponents in a move that has left the casino’s leadership at a loss.

“It was a devastating turn of events,” said one senior executive. “We never expected to lose those two properties.”

The casino is now considering its options, which include filing a formal complaint with game manufacturer Hasbro or appealing to the game’s rulebook for a re-do.

Casino representatives would not speculate on the possible financial impact of the loss but did confirm that it was significant.

This is not the first time that the Atlantic City casino has lost in Monopoly. In an earlier match-up, it also lost its three most valuable properties: Boardwalk, Park Place, and Marvin Gardens.
