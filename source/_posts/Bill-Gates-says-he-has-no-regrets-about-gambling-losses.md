#  Bill Gates says he has no regrets about gambling losses

Tech mogul, Bill Gates, has stated that he does not regret any of the money he has lost in his life through gambling. Bill Gates is one of the richest people on Earth and is currently worth over $86 billion, so it is no secret that he could afford to lose a substantial amount of money without feeling the pinch.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Gates was asked if he had any regrets about his gambling losses, to which he replied "No. I've enjoyed doing it." Gates elaborated on his love for gambling, stating that it is "a fun way to pass the time." Gates also noted that he has never been addicted to gambling and always stops when he starts to lose money.

Interestingly, Bill Gates is not the only tech mogul who enjoys a gamble. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is also a known gambler and has even said that he would be willing to gamble away $1 billion if it meant earning another $10 billion.

#  Bill Gates to pay $40 million in taxes on gambling winnings

Bill Gates is set to pay $40 million in taxes on his gambling winnings. The Microsoft co-founder won the money in a high-stakes poker game last year.

According to tax filings obtained by the Wall Street Journal, Gates won $140 million in the game, but will only pay $40 million in taxes due to the gambling loss deduction. The deduction allows people to subtract their losses from their taxable income.

Gates is not the only high-profile person to use the deduction. In 2016, hedge fund manager John Paulson used it to offset $1 billion in gambling losses.

The deduction has come under fire recently, with some lawmakers calling for it to be eliminated. They argue that it is unfair for wealthy people to be able to write off their losses while the rest of us can't write off our normal expenses like groceries or rent.

But supporters of the deduction say it is important for people's freedom to gamble without having to worry about tax implications. They also point out that the deduction helps create jobs and supports businesses that are associated with gambling.

#  Gates admits to losing $40 million in Vegas

Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, revealed he had lost $40 million in a single day at the casino in Las Vegas.

In an interview with The Telegraph, Gates said "I didn't have a good night at the casino". He also joked about how easy it is to lose money gambling, saying "It's amazing how much money you can lose when you're not trying very hard."

This is not the first time Gates has lost a large sum of money gambling. In 1996, he reportedly lost $7.5 million in one night playing blackjack in Las Vegas.

While Gates may not have had much luck at the casino, he has been much more successful with his other investments. He is currently worth an estimated $86 billion, making him the richest person in the world.

#  Billionaire Bill Gates says he lost $40 million in gambling

Billionaire Bill Gates, one of the richest people in the world, said he has lost $40 million on gambling.

Gates made the admission in an interview with The Telegraph, saying that he had "made an error" when placing bets.

It's not clear what type of gambling Gates was involved in, or what his total net worth is. But Forbes estimates Gates' net worth at $90 billion.

Gates told The Telegraph that he paid taxes on the losses and still considers them "money well spent."

He also joked that he might have to borrow money from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen to make up for the losses.

#  Gates pays $40 million in taxes on gambling winnings, admits to losing $40 million

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has admitted to losing $40 million in one day of gambling at Las Vegas casinos last month. In a statement released on Thursday, Gates said he had paid $40 million in taxes on his winnings, but conceded that he had lost overall.

"I am pleased to say that I came out ahead overall, but I recognize that I could have just as easily ended up a loser on this outing," Gates said in the statement. "Gambling is not without risk."

The statement was issued in response to a report in the Wall Street Journal which said Gates had visited three casinos in Las Vegas and won $27 million at blackjack and roulette, only to lose it all later the same day.

In his statement, Gates also urged other Americans not to follow his lead. "I would strongly counsel against gambling as a way to make money," he said. "It's just too risky."
