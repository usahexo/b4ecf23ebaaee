#  Foxwoods Casino Beats Out Mohegan Sun!

The Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut has been rated the number one casino in the Northeast by Casino Player magazine. The casino, which is owned and operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, bested its nearest competitor, the Mohegan Sun, by a wide margin.

Casino Player’s Nigel Attenborough said of Foxwoods: “This property just keeps getting better and better. The expansion of the gaming floor and the addition of new restaurants and hotel rooms have really made it into a world-class destination.”

Foxwoods is home to over 350,000 square feet of gaming space, including more than 6,300 slot machines and 285 table games. It also offers eight restaurants, four bars/lounges, a spa, and a variety of shopping options.

The Mohegan Sun casino is also very large, with nearly 335,000 square feet of gaming space. However, it falls short of Foxwoods in terms of table games (265 versus 285) and slot machines (6,000 versus 6,300). The Mohegan Sun does offer a wider variety of dining options than Foxwoods does, with 12 restaurants compared to Foxwood’s eight.

In addition to its rating as the top casino in the Northeast, Foxwoods was also named one of the top 50 casinos in the world by Casino Journal magazine.

#  Foxwoods Casino Continues Dominance Over Mohegan Sun

For the last several years, Foxwoods Casino has reigned supreme as the best gambling destination in Connecticut. This week, Foxwoods showcased why it continues to dominate its nearby competitor, Mohegan Sun, with a series of big wins.

The most notable victory came when a patron at Foxwoods’ poker room won a $663,814 jackpot. The lucky player was playing a game of Caribbean Stud Poker and hit a royal flush. The win was the fifth-largest in Foxwoods history.

In addition to this impressive win, Foxwoods also boasted several other big payouts over the past week. For example, one blackjack player took home more than $100,000 and another raked in $40,000 from a slot machine.

Overall, Foxwoods has been enjoying an extremely successful year so far. In April alone, the casino saw nearly $1 million in payouts from its table games alone. This puts Foxwoods on track to have one of its best years ever.

Meanwhile, Mohegan Sun has not had nearly as much luck lately. Earlier this year, the casino was forced to close its high-limit gaming area after revenues plummeted. This followed a number of other recent setbacks for Mohegan Sun, which has allowed Foxwoods to maintain its dominant position in the market.

So if you’re looking for some good gambling action, it’s hard to beat Foxwoods Casino. With plenty of big wins happening on a regular basis, this casino is definitely worth your visit.
